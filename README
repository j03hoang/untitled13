This is our take on take on the code for Micro-Mouse competition, where contestants use a home-built robot to solve a maze.

It is heavily inspired by the UKMARSBOT team. We used their code as a framework and implemented our own functions.

The code contains initialization for all the sensors as well as basic movement.

The project is maintained and developed using PlatformIO and CLion.

Additional information can be found in our Software Requirement Specification document.
