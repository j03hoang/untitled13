/* Using 2 Ultrasonic Sensors and a photo resistor paired with an led
 *      - Ultrasonic Sensor has 15 degree range
 *      - We have 2 photoresistors/LED combos
 *          - must be calibrated to ambient light level :/ ie not very precise
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 *      - Figure out where sensors are going to mounted
 *      - calibrate photo resistor and LED
 *      - sense walls
 *          # 18cm x 18 cm unit cell
 *          - trigger sound
 *          - wait for signal to come back
 *          - if distance is 9 cm (middle of cell) there's a wall ahead
 *      - this class should give steering adjustment
 *
 * Tests:
 *      - ID front wall and stop
 *

 *      - In order to generate the ultrasound, you need to set the Trig on a High State for 10 Âµs.
 *      - That will send out an 8 cycle sonic burst which will travel at the speed sound and will be received in the Echo pin.
 *      - The Echo pin will output the time of travel of the sound wave in microseconds.
 *
 * Datasheet:
 * https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf
 *
 * Maze Info:
 * The maze is composed of 18cm x 18cm unit squares
 * The unit squares are arranged to form a 16 x 16 unit grid.
 * The walls of the units of the maze are 5 cm high and 1.2 cm thick (assume 5% tolerancefor mazes).
 * An outside wall encloses the entire maze.
